        I am writing to ask you to implement the Use of Force policies laid out by Campaign Zero at https://8cantwait.org/. I live in Ward ${this.state.ward} and I care deeply about making our community safer. These policies are simple, common-sense, and data-driven. %0D%0A 
        I am asking you to enact the following policies: %0D%0A
            1. Ban of chokeholds and strongholds %0D%0A
            2. Require warning before shooting %0D%0A
            3. Ban of shooting at moving vehicles %0D%0A
            4. Require comprehensive reporting %0D%0A
        Campaign Zero's data shows that if you implement these policies, in addition to the other policies already in place in Chicago, we can decrease police violence in our community by 72%. All of these policies can be implemented with your vote on City Council, and Iâ€™m asking you not to hesitate to make our city safer.
        %0D%0A
        Sincerely, %0D%0A
